# Reddit-But-Better
Have you ever scrolled past a meme without upvoting and felt like a piece of shit? Well this is the solution for degenerates like you! RedditButBetter uses computer vision to scan your emotions and upvotes posts if you like what you're seeing.


Aight to to get started, make a venv or conda env and install all the required modules and libraries. I'm too lazy to list them so figure it yourself. 

Once you've done all that boring shit, then run redditbutbetter.py. This should work on a mac, however if you don't have a mac, then fuck you. Get a mac.

*Note: you might have to tweak the pyautogui click coordinates a bit depending on your computer to make it click on the right spot. I have a macbook pro idk what you all have.

This project is pretty stupid ngl. But it was fun to do so yeah.

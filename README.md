# Reddit-But-Better

*Disclaimer: This is a joke repository I made when I was 14. The code does what it says it does but it made with the intent of pure comedic relief.

Have you ever scrolled past a meme without upvoting and felt bad? Well this is the solution for people like you! RedditButBetter uses computer vision to scan your emotions and upvotes posts if you like what you're seeing.

Aight to to get started, make a venv or conda env and install all the required modules and libraries. I'm too lazy to list them so figure it yourself. 

Once you've done all the setup, then run redditbutbetter.py. This should work on a mac, or anything with a camera. If it doesn't, then idk lol.

*Note: you might have to tweak the pyautogui click coordinates a bit depending on your computer to make it click on the right spot. I have a macbook pro idk what you all have.

This project is pretty stupid ngl. But it was fun to do so yeah.
